# FakeStore ðŸ“±
The FakeStore app is a modern SwiftUI application built with a focus on maintainability, testability, scalability, simplicity, and performance. By leveraging Clean Architecture and MVVM principles, the project ensures a well-structured and modular codebase that enhances code reusability and separation of concerns.
## Coding Standards
- **Multi-Module Architecture:** Designed with a modular project structure to ensure better separation of responsibilities, enhanced build times, and improved scalability.
- **SwiftUI:** Utilises the latest declarative UI toolkit for iOS, enabling the development of responsive, beautiful, fast, and reusable UIs.
- **Swift:** The primary programming language used for development, ensuring modern, safe, and performance-focused code.
- **Async Programming:** Utilises `async/await` for improved concurrency, ensuring responsive and efficient task handling.
- **KFImage:** Leverages the KIngFisher Image to efficiently load images from remote sources, enhancing user experience with seamless image handling with effective cacheing.
- **Unit Testing:** Ensures comprehensive code coverage and reliability through structured testing.
- **UI Testing:** Provides robust testing to validate user interface interactions and maintain application stability.
## Networking
- Used Local Swift Package Manager to separate network-related code for better modularization and maintainability.
## APP Features
- Display a list of products.
- Show detailed product information.
- Implement a dummy add-to-cart functionality with a success alert.
- Handle various view states such as no network, no products, loading, and error states.
### Project Structure

#### [`Data Module `](/FakeStore/FakeStore/Data)

Manages application data, including remote sources, and relies on the domain layer for contracts. Tests for the Repositories are implemented here.

#### [`Domain Module `](FakeStore/FakeStore/Domain)

Contains business logic, including repositories, models, and use cases. Tests for use cases are conducted in this layer.

#### [`Presentation Module `](FakeStore/FakeStore/Presentation)

Includes screens and their ViewModels, following the MVVM pattern. Uses separate data models for the presentation layer, distinct from domain models.

Here's a breakdown of the module dependencies:
- `app` depends on `data`, `domain`, `presentation`.
- `presentation` depends on `domain`,`data`.
- `data` depends on `domain`.

### Testing
- Tested the Product Repositories in the data layer.
- Validated the use cases in the domain layer.
- Conducted tests on the view models in the presentation layer.
- Performed UI tests in the presentation layer.

## How to Run the Project
